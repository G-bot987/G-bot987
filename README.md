### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Full stack web developer with a background in Marketing and extensive client handling experience. My drive and intrigue for coding inspired me to achieve an A- certificate in web development through the University of Birmingham. Experience using; React.js, Node.js, JavaScript, MySQL, MongoDB, Git, Command Line, JQuery, CSS, Bootstrap, Express.js, HTML5.
Ambition and drive to be successful in web development ensured successful completion of this course while retaining full time employment. This experience in client facing industries, most recently while working from home has required discipline and strong time management. Evidenced by an exceptional quality assurance score and attendance record. Coupled with  recent success at Birmingham and marketing acumen that makes for a user focused results driven developer looking forward to taking advantage of opportunities both domestically and internationally that will see me add specificity and nuance to my code.
